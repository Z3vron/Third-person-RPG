This is my game - there are lots of bugs and issues with it but i am slowly repeairing them and adding some new features. Game doesn't look to good visualy but i never 
intended to make visually pleasing game - I am not an artist but i like coding so i focus on writing mechanics for the game.

Version 1.04
Fetaures included/done in most part:
- walking and rotating camera
- player can attack enemy
- enemy will detect player, chase him and attack him
- player inventory system with diffrent sections(weapons/items/materials)
- object inventory
- bonuses to combat base on weapon class (dagger -> faster attacks) - need more time and ideas but first i want to improve overall combat system
-
- 
- lock on closest enemy and target switching

Known Bugs:
- Player can jump on and stay on enemy
- 
-

Things that definitely need redoing:
- animator system - for now i have almost none animations so that isn't such a big issue but later on, it will become massive one if i stay with current approach
- equip weapon into hand - i have 2 pivots (one for left and second for right habd) on each weapon and scripts don't work with each other ( look into  order of execution of scripts)
- player current speed - i need it to change animations transi
